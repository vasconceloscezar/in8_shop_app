## How to run this project <a name="project-setup">

After, select a device to run on any emulator or your own, clone this repo, and in the terminal run:

```



## Project Decisions <a name="project-decisions"></a>
To kickstart the project, I'm using [this repo](https://github.com/abuanwar072/E-commerce-Complete-Flutter-UI) as a boilerplate.

The boilerplate provides a Splash screen a Home Screen and a Cart Screen, but all of them lacks funcionality. 


___
## Some [Providers](./providers/) were created: 
### UserProvider 
Stores user data after login, as well as the access token for requests. 
### CartProvider 
Contains all the logic related to adding/removing products to the cart, as well as purchasing the products. 
### ProductProvider 
Responsible for calling the API that loads the products. 
### PurchasesProvider 
Retrieves the user's purchase data. 


___
After logging in, the user's data is saved locally on the device, avoiding the need for the user to log in again when closing and reopening the app.
